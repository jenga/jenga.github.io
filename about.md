title: About me 
---

I am a Data Scientist focusing on the application of data towards decision-making in healthcare. At heart, I am a generalist seeking to apply a data-driven approach to life. My studies and experience span software development, data analytics, bioinformatics, neuroscience, computational biology, and machine learning. While no longer a student (finally!), I am always seeking to learn new things.

This blog is a collection of post directed towards big data, data science, and decision making. I focus on healthcare and academia, but may stray off focus from time to time to look at some interesting problems. Hopefully, the material here will demonstrate how we can move closer to a data-driven life and culture.
