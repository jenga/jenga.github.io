# Vapor for Jekyll

This is a port of the [Vapor theme](https://github.com/sethlilly/Vapor) for [Ghost](http://ghost.org/) to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)

*Vapor* is Copyright (c) 2013 [Seth Lilly](https://github.com/sethlilly) - Released under The MIT License.

In [Seth Lilly](https://github.com/sethlilly)'s words:

> Minimal and responsive with a focus on typography, *Vapor* is a theme that embodies the core concept of [Ghost](http://ghost.org/)&mdash;it fades into the background, bringing the focus to your content.

See *Vapor* on *Ghost* in action at [Hipster Ghost](http://hipsterghost.com/). See the *Jekyll* port of *Vapor* you're looking at live [here](http://lucafoschini.github.io/jekyll-vapor/).

## Features

The port includes:

* *Ghost*'s *Vapor* 1.2.1 functionalities
* About Page
* Google Analytics

## How to

Run `jekyll -w serve --baseurl ''` in the root directory.

## Thanks

This porting drew inspiration from [Rosario Lascuna](https://github.com/rosario)'s [kasper](https://github.com/rosario/kasper) port of [Casper](https://github.com/tryghost/casper), the default *Ghost* theme.
