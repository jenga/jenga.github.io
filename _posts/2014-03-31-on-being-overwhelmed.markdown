> "This is water"

In his address to the Kenyon graduating class, David Foster Wallace made the comment "the compelling reason for maybe choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type thing to worship is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive...Worship your intellect, being seen as smart, you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out. But the insidious thing about these forms of worship is not that they're evil or sinful, it's that they're unconscious. They are default settings."

I worship my intellect, and it is eating me alive. The amount of information out there is overwhelming and I feel an obsessive need to know it all. To the point that I can no longer enjoy getting deep in a subject because there is probably something else I should be looking at.

By my nature, I am a polyglot. I have studied computer science, biology, neuroscience, religion, data science, and clinical research. On any given day, I will read articles on startup strategies, machine learning algorithms, and synaptic mechanisms of plasticity in between configuring servers, writing blog posts on knowledge translation in healthcare, designing data management systems, and performing a statistical analysis on animal breeding patterns. It sounds great - it is overwhelming.

In the end, I need to have a purpose of some sort. There has to be something that I actually care about, that my focus and passion can be directed towards or this will destroy me.
