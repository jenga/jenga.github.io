Let's consider data to be a raw resource. In order to take data and change into a useful knowledge product (because data products are no good), there is a process of extraction, refinement, and manufacturing. When a certain group owns or controls all aspects of this, it would be known as a data keiretsu (if they owned all aspects, it could arguably be called a data zaibatsu, but potato, potato).

> Owning the data pipeline: extraction to consumer

1. Identify the data sources
2. Gain access to/own the data sources
3. Store (Drilling)
4. Aggregate (Transport)
5. Refine (Processing)
6. Analyze (Manufacturing)
7. Visualize (Packaging)
8. Deploy (Retail)
