When reading different people's opinions on what makes a startup succeed, one of the biggest factors that is identified is the need to have a product/market fit. Your product needs to fit some need in the market, or it will fail.

What is the need of the market for data products? As Marc Andreeson points out, VmWare made their own market. I wonder if it is not the same way for data products. Companies certainly can make use of data: identifying customer churn, predicting what products someone wants to buy, etc. However, what about tools that give the individual the power to make data-driven decisions, decisions based on knowledge derived from population level experience? Is there a market for that? I think there is.
