Academia has a tendency to decide to "do thing differently". It makes sense - if you take some of the smartest people in the world (or people who think they are the smartest) and give them a problem to solve, you are going to get new, innovative ideas. However, academia often takes an insular mindset when deciding on approaches, which is largely detrimental to full-throttle progress. We see ourselves as this foci of knowledge generation, with ideas pushing outward. We are the cutting edge, we are the front line, we discover the undiscovered and make knowable the unknown. Or do we?

> We forget to look outward and see what is already being done

Of course we do! ... some of the time. Other times, we forget to look outward and see what is already being done in other industries and even other academic disciplines. As an illustration, let's look at Knowledge Translation (KT). The Canadian Institutes for Health Research defines KT as "a dynamic and iterative process that includes synthesis, dissemination, exchange and ethically-sound application of knowledge to improve the health of Canadians, provide more effective health services and products and strengthen the health care system." KT has developed into its own industry, of sorts, and drives many of the funding opportunities within the medical research field. Nearly every application must have KT focus. KT has its own vocabulary and lingo; there are KT consultants who determine how your grant should be worded and what your strategy should be. In the end, KT is about one thing - how do I take knowledge and disseminate it to effect change? This is an important question, but _let's be clear_: it is not unique to medical research. In fact, I would argue that this problem has _in general_ been solved in other industries and sectors.

Let's break down the definition above. KT is a "dynamic and iterative process". Well, that sounds alot like the Agile Software Development methodologies that exist and which replaced non-iterative "waterfall" methods several decades past. KT involves "synthesis, dissemination, exchange, and ... application of knowledge". In my mind, this is the research and development process which is practiced by thousands of companies. It could be argued that other companies don't produce pure "knowledge" - but if we view knowledge AS the product of academia, then maybe we can revise this to be "synthesis, dissemination, exchange and application of a product". We create a product, we try and get people to understand why then need it (buy-in), we exchange that product through patents, publications, open-sourcing, selling, and we apply the product wherever we can. In the case of KT, we apply knowledge (our product) in order to "improve the health of [people], provide more effective health services and products and strengthen the health care system". This latter part of the definition is, of course, specific to healthcare. But it could just as easily be replaced with "improve your efficiency, allow your company to provide effective service and strengthen the industry". 

I am not trying to downplay the importance of knowledge translation within healthcare. My point of contention is that KT is no different from R&D. There are, of course, differences
